    "'''Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the concept of simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential details and hiding unnecessary implementation details. It allows us to create a blueprint or a model of an object that includes only the relevant attributes and behaviors, while hiding the internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of abstraction can be seen with a car. When you interact with a car, you don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine works or how the transmission shifts gears. Instead, you can focus on using the car's essential features such as steering, accelerating, and braking. In this scenario, the car acts as an abstraction of a complex system, providing a simplified interface for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is implemented through classes and objects. A class defines the abstract blueprint that represents a concept, while objects are instances of the class that can be created and used in the program. By encapsulating the internal details and exposing only the necessary methods and properties, abstraction allows programmers to work with simplified and manageable objects, promoting code reusability and modularity.'''\n",
